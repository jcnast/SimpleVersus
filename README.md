A hand-made c++ game using SDL2

Up to 4 players fight to be the last man left standing in a small combat arena game.

CONTROLLERS ARE MANDATORY, and the game will not start unless you have at least 2 players playing

Everything in this game was hand made using SDL2 and is meant to showcase my coding abilities, understanding of C++ and
knowledge of what goes in to making a game/ game loop.

CURRENTLY UPDATES ARE ON HOLD AS A PROCEED WITH TRYING TO FIND A JOB, once this is done ...

I plan on updating this game as time goes on, and currently have plans to add in upgrades for players to pick up, the ability
to change the screen size, actual sprite changes and additional levels.
